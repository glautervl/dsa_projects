# Algorithm2025 - Data Structures and Algorithms in Multiple Languages

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in different programming languages. Each implementation focuses on demonstrating different time complexities (Big O notation) and language-specific features.

## Projects

### [C++ DSA](./cpp_dsa/README.md)

A C++ implementation focusing on modern C++ features (C++17), RAII principles, and strong type safety. The project uses CMake for build management and Google Test for comprehensive testing.

### [Java DSA](./java_dsa/README.md)

A Java implementation leveraging Java's object-oriented features and collections framework. The project uses Maven for build management and includes comprehensive unit testing with JUnit.

### [Python DSA](./python_dsa/README.md)

A Python implementation showcasing Python's built-in data structures and standard library features. The project uses modern Python development tools including pytest, black, and mypy.

### [JavaScript DSA](./javascript_dsa/README.md)

A JavaScript implementation demonstrating modern JavaScript features and best practices. The project uses Node.js and includes comprehensive testing with Jest.

### [TypeScript DSA](./typescript_dsa/README.md)

A TypeScript implementation focusing on type safety and modern TypeScript features. The project includes comprehensive type definitions and uses modern development tools.

### [Rust DSA](./rust_dsa/README.md)

A Rust implementation showcasing Rust's unique features like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes. The project uses Cargo for package management and includes benchmarking capabilities.

### [Go DSA](./go_dsa/README.md)

A Go implementation demonstrating Go's concurrency features and standard library. The project follows Go's standard project layout and includes comprehensive testing.

### [C DSA](./c_dsa/README.md)

A C implementation focusing on low-level programming concepts and memory management. The project uses CMake for build management and includes comprehensive testing with CUnit.

## Common Features Across All Projects

Each project includes implementations of the following time complexities:

- O(1) - Constant Time
- O(log N) - Logarithmic Time
- O(N) - Linear Time
- O(N log N) - Linearithmic Time
- O(N²) - Quadratic Time
- O(N³) - Cubic Time
- O(2^N) - Exponential Time
- O(N!) - Factorial Time

## Project Structure

Each language implementation follows its own conventions and best practices while maintaining a consistent focus on:

- Clear code organization
- Comprehensive testing
- Detailed documentation
- Performance considerations
- Language-specific features
- Modern development practices
